          <h1 id="three"<br>Different Methods of Identity Theft</h1>
          <p><br>
            There are many other specific, clever methods for thieves to steal your identity or personal information, such as:
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Phishing </strong> — Scammers often use phishing emails to trick victims into providing personal or financial information. Phishing emails can be deceiving in that they may appear to come from a known or trusted company, such as a bank or an online retailer, and use various tactics to get the victim to click a link or open an attachment.</li>
            <li><strong>Data Breaches</strong> — A data breach is the intentional or unintentional release or theft of information, whether it is due to a cyberattack or simply the improper disposal of physical documents. If an individual is notified of a breach, their financial or personal information may have been exposed. The theft of usernames and passwords from data breaches may also fuel credential stuffing attacks in which criminals use stolen username and password combinations to hack into other accounts.</li>
            <li><strong>Change Of Address </strong> — Thieves can fill out change-of-address request forms. Once your mail is sent to them, they can access your personal information.</li>
            <li><strong>Cloning Credit Card Information</strong> — An employee of, say, a restaurant, gas station or retail store, can swipe your credit card through a device that copies the magnetic strip information. It can be transferred to a counterfeit credit card, which can make purchases.</li>
            <li><strong>Vishing </strong>— Fraudsters can also use phone calls, also known as voice phishing or vishing, to target potential victims. Phone scammers sometimes use promises, like the offer of a prize, or threats, such as the risk of not getting a tax refund, to prompt victims into giving up personal information. Scammers will also use spoofing to send falsified information to a caller ID. A spoofed call looks like it’s coming from a local number or a trusted organization when it could be originating anywhere in the world.</li>
